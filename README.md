# DataFestAfrica Hackathon 2024: Improving Academic Outcome For Secondary Education

## üéØ Project Brief

### Preamble
An important general concern all over the African continent has been the sub-par quality of elementary and secondary education, which has been further highlighted by the recent push to Computer-Based tests for students in ultimate classes (especially SSS3). In fairness, there has been some action taken by CSOs, governments, and other bodies to improve the quality of education, and by extension, students‚Äô performance.

Recent statistics from **JAMB** (a Nigerian pre-tertiary examination governing body) show that **76%** (approx. **4 out of 5**) of students who participated in the 2024 UTME scored less than **200 (50%)**. This interesting insight emphasizes the need to find proactive solutions to this problem.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Resources
Any data analytics tool of your choice.

### üë£ Process

#### Requirement
You and your team have been contracted as consultants by a school somewhere in Africa (feel free to take any country or location of your choice) to help them build a solution that proactively leverages data to improve candidates‚Äô performance not just in **JAMB**, but in all their upcoming final exams.

With students set to write **JAMB** and **WASSCE** again soon, you‚Äôve been given a goal to ensure that an overwhelming majority of candidates score above average in their performance.

#### How do we use data to ensure the students have great performance in the exams?

### Objectives:
1. **Identify possible problems** students might be facing while writing these exams bearing in mind that this would involve starting from scratch, as most schools do not have the foundational data infrastructure to solve this problem.
2. **Generate your data** through any means based on the needs of your solution while ensuring that your data adequately reflects the state of the African education ecosystem.
3. **Design an enterprise data solution** for the school‚Äôs data collection, pipelining, warehousing, automation, and reporting needs.
4. **Create an optimised model** that predicts the likelihood of a student passing or failing their upcoming exam based on their academic history. Consider all factors that could affect a student's upcoming result aside from their previous exam scores.
5. **Make relevant recommendations** to the stakeholders on how they can help improve the performance of the students based on your solution.
